# FightersJewelrySeekers
Agents able to seek, collect and classify jewelry in a 3d environment

# Run the Simulation
You can run the simulation in 2 ways one adding the proyect throught the unity hub, in this case you would add a project from disc and use the Jewlery carpet.
The other way is throught the use of the unitypackege which is stored in this proyect.

In case of any problems with the package, the version use to create this proyect was Unity 6000.0.44f1.

Inside the proyect we can access the simulation which is found on scenes SampleScene.

To adjust the parameters for the agents you need to select the GameManager object in the scene, and then make changes with the Game Configuration script.

To adjust the speed of the agents you need to open the Rumbas object which contains the 3 models for the agents, inside those object it exist an script called Agent Controller where the speed and rotation speed can be changed.

If you do not see the timer on the game view, change the display type to 1920 X 1080
